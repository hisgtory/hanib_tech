Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Git&Github"
- Text block with character icons (Hanib and N, looking stressed/panicked):
  - "파일을 잘못 저장해서 덮어쓰면 안 되는 파일을 덮어씀" (Saved a file incorrectly and overwrote a file that shouldn't have been overwritten)
  - "필요 없을 줄 알고 삭제 후 휴지통까지 비웠는데 갑자기 필요해짐" (Deleted a file thinking it wasn't needed, even emptied the trash bin, but then suddenly needed it)
  - "이런 상황🤯 다들 경험해 보신 적 있으신가요?" (These situations 🤯 Have you all experienced this?)
- Main explanation below: "프로젝트를 운영하다 보면 버그로 인한 롤백, 폐기된 기능에서 일부만 복구 등 프로젝트의 코드들을 유연하게 관리해야 하는 상황들이 자주 생기게 되지요. Git은 이러한 상황들에 대응하기 위해 탄생한 버전 관리 시스템이에요." (When managing projects, situations often arise where you need to flexibly manage project code, such as rollbacks due to bugs, or partially restoring discarded features. Git is a version control system created to respond to these situations.)

Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The top section uses relatable, frustrating scenarios of data loss or file management errors, accompanied by stressed character icons.

Tone and Manner:
- Relatable, problem-focused, empathetic.
- It starts by highlighting common pain points that developers or computer users might experience.
- Then introduces Git as a solution to these problems.

Storytelling Method:
- This card introduces the "why" behind Git by first presenting common problems it solves.
- It uses a "problem/solution" narrative structure.
- The scenarios are designed to resonate with the audience's own experiences, making the need for a tool like Git more apparent.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, effectively motivates the need for version control by starting with relatable frustrations.
