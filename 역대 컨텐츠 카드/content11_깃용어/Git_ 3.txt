- Main text:
  - "아마존 사이트가 평균 12초에 한번 배포된다는 사실 알고 계신가요?" (Did you know that the Amazon site is deployed on average once every 12 seconds?)
  - "아마존보다 인원이 훨씬 적은 스타트업도 하루에 여러번 배포를 하는게 일반적이에요." (Even startups with far fewer personnel than Amazon typically deploy multiple times a day.)
  - "배포를 자주 하면 다른 개발자가 작업 중이던 코드도 같이 배포되는거 아닌가?!🤔 하는 궁금증을 가질 수 있는데요." (If you deploy frequently, you might wonder, "Doesn't code other developers are working on get deployed too?!" 🤔)

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card is text-focused, setting up a problem/question related to frequent deployments.

Tone and Manner:
- Intriguing, sets up a common concern.
- Uses a surprising fact (Amazon's deployment frequency) to grab attention.
- The question posed at the end is designed to resonate with a common fear or misunderstanding about collaborative development and deployment.

Storytelling Method:
- This card introduces the concept of "Branch" by first highlighting the challenge of frequent deployments in a collaborative environment.
- It uses a "problem-posing" approach to lead into the explanation of how branches help solve this issue.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, aims to explain the necessity and utility of branching by first presenting a relatable problem in software development.
