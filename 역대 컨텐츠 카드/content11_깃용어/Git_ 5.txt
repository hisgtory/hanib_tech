Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Git"
- Title bubble (black with white text): "Commit, Push"
- Main explanation:
  - "개발을 하면서 중간 중간 묶음이 될 수 있는 단위로 나누어 커밋을 하고, 푸시를 해요." (While developing, work is divided into units that can be bundled, then committed and pushed.) (커밋 - commit, 푸시 - push are highlighted in yellow)
  - "별도의 브랜치에서 작업을 하기 때문에 작업 중이던 코드를 푸시해도 영향을 주지 않지요." (Since work is done in a separate branch, pushing code under development doesn't affect others.)
  - "그래서 작업 중인 코드를 GitHub 서버에 백업할 겸 자주 푸시를 하는데요." (So, to back up code in progress to the GitHub server, pushes are done frequently.)
- Diagram:
  - "A 브랜치" (Branch A) is shown as a timeline.
  - Character Hanib (at laptop) is shown with three yellow speech bubbles saying "Push!" pointing to different points on the timeline.

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card explains the concepts of "Commit" and "Push" in the context of a development workflow.
- The diagram illustrates frequent pushes to a branch.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, practical.
- Explains the rationale behind frequent commits and pushes (breaking work into units, backup).

Storytelling Method:
- This card elaborates on "Commit" and "Push," which were mentioned in the workflow overview (`Git_ 2.png`).
- It emphasizes working in separate branches to avoid impacting others and highlights pushing as a way to back up work.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, focuses on good practices in using Git, such as frequent commits and pushes within a branch.
