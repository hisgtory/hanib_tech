Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Git"
- Title bubble (black with white text): "Merge"
- Main explanation:
  - "변경된 F, G를 포함하는 커밋 H가 main 브랜치에 생겼어요!" (Commit H, including changes F and G, has been created on the main branch!)
  - Diagram showing the "main" branch now extended to commit H, which incorporates changes from "feature/issue-1" (D, E) and "bugfix/issue-1" (F, G). Commit H is highlighted with sparkles.
  - "Merge가 되면 자동 또는 수동으로 서버에 배포를 해요." (When a Merge occurs, it is deployed to the server automatically or manually.)

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card visually demonstrates the result of a merge operation, showing how different branches are combined into the main branch, leading to a new commit (H).

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, conclusive (regarding the merge process).
- Clearly illustrates the outcome of merging.

Storytelling Method:
- This card shows the final state after merging branches, as discussed in previous cards.
- The diagram is a continuation of the one in `Git_ 4.png`, now showing the successful integration of feature and bugfix branches into the main branch.
- It also links the merge action to the deployment process.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, provides a clear visual and textual explanation of what happens after a merge and its connection to deployment.
