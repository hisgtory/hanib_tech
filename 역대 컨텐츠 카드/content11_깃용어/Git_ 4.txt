Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Git"
- Title bubble (black with white text): "Branch"
- Main text:
  - "Branch(나뭇가지) 덕분에 개발 중이던 코드가 같이 배포되는 일은 없어요." (Thanks to Branch(나뭇가지 - tree branch), code under development doesn't get deployed together.)
  - "개발자들은 새로운 태스크를 시작함과 동시에 새로운 브랜치를 만들어서 작업하고, 라이브 배포에는 'main' 또는 'master'라는 이름의 기본 브랜치만 사용하거든요!" (When developers start a new task, they create a new branch and work on it, and only the default branch named 'main' or 'master' is used for live deployment!)
- Diagram:
  - "main" branch shown as a sequence A -> B -> C.
  - "feature/issue-1" labeled "new branch" branching off from B, with commits D -> E.
  - "bugfix/issue-1" labeled "new branch" branching off from C, with commits F -> G.

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card explains the concept of branching in Git using a clear diagram.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, reassuring (addressing the concern from the previous card).
- The analogy "나뭇가지" (tree branch) for "Branch" makes the term more intuitive.

Storytelling Method:
- This card directly answers the question/concern raised in the previous card (`Git_ 3.png`).
- It explains how branches allow for isolated development, preventing unfinished code from being deployed.
- The diagram visually demonstrates how feature and bugfix branches diverge from the main branch.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, clearly explains a fundamental Git concept (branching) and its importance in managing development and deployment workflows.
