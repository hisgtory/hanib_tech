  - "main 브랜치에 내가 수정한 코드를 반영하기 전 Pull Request (줄여서 PR, 풀리퀘)를 올려요." (Before reflecting my modified code on the main branch, I submit a Pull Request (PR for short, pool-li-kwe).) "Pull Request (줄여서 PR, 풀리퀘)" is highlighted in yellow.
  - "변경된 코드에 대해 동료 개발자들이 피드백을 주고 개선하며 서로 생각을 공유하는데요 이 과정을 코드 리뷰라고 해요." (Fellow developers give feedback on the changed code, improve it, and share thoughts; this process is called code review.) "코드 리뷰" (code review) is highlighted in yellow.

  - N: "수정했어요!" (I've fixed it!)
  - Hanib: "LGTM👍" (LGTM👍 - Looks Good To Me)
