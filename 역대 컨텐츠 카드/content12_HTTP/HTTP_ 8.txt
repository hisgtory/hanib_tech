Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "HTTP status code"
- Title bubble (black with white text): "500 Internal Server Error 🧯" (Fire extinguisher emoji added)
- Main explanation:
  - "서버에서 에러가 발생한 경우 실행중이던 코드가 더 이상 진행되지 않고 500을 응답해요." (If an error occurs on the server, the running code stops proceeding and responds with 500.)
  - "다른 응답 코드들과는 다르게 개발자들이 의도하지 않은 응답 코드예요." (Unlike other response codes, this is an unintended response code from developers.)
  - "개발자들은 500 에러의 발생율을 최대한 낮추기 위해 노력해요." (Developers strive to minimize the occurrence rate of 500 errors as much as possible.)
- Call to action/engagement: "500 뿐만 아니라 501, 502 등 5xx 응답 코드를 발견하게 된다면 저에게 알려주세요!" (If you discover not only 500 but also 501, 502, or other 5xx response codes, please let me know!)
- Character Hanib peeking from the bottom with a speech bubble showing "..." (ellipsis), possibly indicating they are listening or waiting for user input.

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card explains the "500 Internal Server Error" HTTP status code.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, explains a critical server-side error.
- Emphasizes that this is an unexpected error that developers try to avoid.

Storytelling Method:
- This card focuses on a significant server-side error code (500).
- It clarifies that this indicates an issue on the server itself, not with the client's request.
- The call to action for users to report 5xx errors is a bit unusual for a general explanation card but might be specific to the channel's interactive style.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, explains a common and often frustrating server error, highlighting that it's an unplanned issue developers work to prevent.
