- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "React VS React Native"
- Main title: "RN을 추격하는 Flutter" (Flutter, chasing RN (React Native))
- Explanation:
  - "Flutter도 React Native처럼 한 번만 개발해서 iOS, Android 앱을 모두 출시할 수 있는 프레임워크예요." (Flutter, like React Native, is a framework that allows you to develop once and release for both iOS and Android apps.)
  - "iOS, Android의 UI가 완벽하게 동일함을 보장하지는 못하는 RN과는 다르게, 개발한 코드가 두 플랫폼에 동일하게 보여지는 것을 확실히 보장하고 속도도 RN보다 빠르다는 이유로 빠르게 성장하고 있어요." (Unlike RN, which cannot guarantee perfectly identical UI on iOS and Android, Flutter ensures that the developed code looks identical on both platforms and is growing rapidly due to its faster speed compared to RN.)
  - "앱의 UI 그대로 웹사이트를 만들 수도 있고, 구글에서 만들기 때문에 안드로이드 지원도 확실하게 받을 수 있다는 장점은 덤이에요." (The ability to create a website with the exact same app UI, and the advantage of guaranteed Android support because it's made by Google, are bonuses.)
