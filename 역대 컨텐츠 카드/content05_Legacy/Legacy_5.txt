- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Legacy"
- Number "2" (indicating the second reason).
- Explanation: "여러 기능들을 테스트하다가 복잡도가 높아지고 어느 순간 감당하기 힘들어지기도 해요." (While testing various features, complexity increases, and at some point, it can become difficult to manage.)
- Character Hanib (looking overwhelmed, standing on a shaky, poorly constructed platform of bricks): "...아니 어쩌다가..." (...How on earth did it come to this...)

Visual Description:
- The character Hanib is shown standing precariously on a platform made of mismatched and unstable-looking bricks, symbolizing a complex and fragile system. Squiggly lines around Hanib indicate instability or stress.
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.

Tone and Manner:
- Relatable, empathetic. It describes a common scenario in software development where complexity grows organically and can become unmanageable.
- The character's expression and the visual metaphor of the unstable platform effectively convey the feeling of being overwhelmed by accumulated complexity.

Storytelling Method:
- This card continues explaining why legacy accumulates, focusing on the natural increase in complexity as features are added and tested.
- The visual storytelling is strong, with the character's predicament illustrating the point made in the text.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Highlights the challenges of managing growing complexity in software projects, a key factor in the creation of legacy systems.
