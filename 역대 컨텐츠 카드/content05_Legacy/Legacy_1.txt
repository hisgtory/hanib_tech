Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech"
- Main text at bottom: "레거시가 뭐예요?" (What is Legacy?), with "레거시" (Legacy) circled in yellow.

Visual Description:
- The character "Hanib" (the round-headed, knowledgeable one) is shown walking away, leaving footprints. This visually represents the idea of something "left behind" or "old," which ties into the concept of legacy systems.
- The background is bright yellow.

Tone and Manner:
- Inquisitive, introductory.
- The visual of the character walking away and leaving footprints is a clever and subtle way to hint at the meaning of "legacy" before it's explicitly defined.
- The direct question "What is Legacy?" is typical of the channel's style of tackling tech terms.

Storytelling Method:
- This is the introductory card for a new topic: Legacy systems.
- It uses a visual metaphor (footprints) and a direct question to engage the audience and set the stage for an explanation.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Clean, visually engaging, and sets a clear learning objective for the upcoming content series.
