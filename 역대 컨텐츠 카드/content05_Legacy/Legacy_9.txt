- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Legacy"
- Main text: "저 또한 과거의 내가 작성한 코드에 매일 괴롭힘당하고 있기도 하구요..(›´-`‹)" (I too am tormented daily by the code my past self wrote..(›´-`‹))
- Below this, on the left: "과거의 한입" (Past Hanib) with an arrow pointing to a drawing of a pig-like character frantically typing on a laptop, with smoke/steam coming off it.
- On the right, a meme image (from the movie Interstellar, the scene where Cooper is in the Tesseract surrounded by bookshelves) with the caption: "안돼.. 그만둬!!!" (No.. Stop!!!)

Visual Description:
- The card humorously depicts the ongoing struggle with one's own past code.
- The "Past Hanib" character is drawn as a frantic, possibly less skilled version (pig-like, contrasting with the usual round-headed Hanib).
- The Interstellar meme is used effectively to represent the current self's despair or warning to their past self.
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle that has a light gray bottom section.

Tone and Manner:
- Highly relatable, humorous, and self-deprecating.
- The use of the (›´-`‹) emoticon and the Interstellar meme adds to the comedic effect and resonates with internet culture.
- It normalizes the experience of finding one's own past work challenging or cringeworthy.

Storytelling Method:
- This card uses humor and a popular meme to illustrate the ongoing impact of legacy code, even when it's self-inflicted.
- It personifies "Past Hanib" as a separate, somewhat chaotic entity, adding to the comedic narrative.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Funny and empathetic, creating a shared experience with the audience about the trials of dealing with old code. It reinforces the idea that even experienced developers face these challenges.
