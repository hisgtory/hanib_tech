Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Legacy"
- Main question (from character N, implied): "그럼 이 레거시, 어떻게 해야 되나요..?" (Then this legacy, what should be done about it..?)
- Character Hanib's response (speech bubble): "앗 회의 시간이.. 다음에 알려드릴게요" (Oops, it's time for a meeting.. I'll tell you next time)
- Characters N (cat-like, looking curious) and Hanib (round-headed, looking slightly sheepish or busy) are shown.
- Bottom text on a light gray banner: "다음 편에 계속 :)" (To be continued in the next episode :))

Visual Description:
- The two main characters, N and Hanib, are depicted. N looks towards Hanib expectantly. Hanib is slightly turned away, giving an excuse.
- The background is a light gray, consistent with other informational cards in this series.

Tone and Manner:
- Engaging, creates anticipation.
- Hanib's excuse ("meeting time") is a common, relatable way to defer a complex topic.
- The "To be continued :)" message clearly signals that more content on this topic will follow.

Storytelling Method:
- This card acts as a cliffhanger or a transition to a subsequent part of the "Legacy" series.
- It poses a crucial follow-up question (what to do about legacy) and then defers the answer, encouraging the audience to look out for future content.
- The interaction between N and Hanib continues the character-driven narrative.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Builds anticipation for future content, acknowledges the complexity of the topic (dealing with legacy) by suggesting it needs more dedicated explanation.
