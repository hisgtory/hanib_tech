Tone and Manner:
- Engaging, empathetic, and problem-oriented.
- It directly addresses a pain point for developers ("suffering," "headache").
- Positions "Hanib Tech" as the solution provider or explainer for this common issue.

Storytelling Method:
- This appears to be a promotional image for an Instagram Story or a series of posts about "Legacy."
- It uses a hook question ("Have you ever seen...") to draw the audience in.
- It clearly states the topic and promises an explanation from the channel.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Aims to capture attention quickly, highlight a relevant problem for the target audience (IT professionals/developers), and drive engagement by promising valuable information. The vertical format suggests it's designed for mobile-first consumption, likely on Instagram Stories.
