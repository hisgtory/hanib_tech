Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Legacy"
- Question bubble: "Q. 레거시는 왜 쌓이나요?" (Q. Why does legacy accumulate?)
- Number "1" (indicating the first reason).
- Explanation: "생존이 제일 중요한 스타트업에서는 더 중요한 목표 달성을 위해 알면서도 레거시를 쌓기도 해요." (In startups where survival is paramount, legacy sometimes accumulates knowingly for the sake of achieving more critical goals.)
- Character Hanib (sweating, stressed at laptop, behind a crumbling brick wall): "바쁘다 바빠.." (So busy, so busy..)
- Caption at bottom: "(잘 못 된걸 알면서도 고칠 시간이 없는 환경..)" ((An environment where you know something is wrong but have no time to fix it..))

Visual Description:
- The character Hanib is depicted as stressed and overworked, trying to code while a brick wall (symbolizing accumulating legacy or problems) is behind them. Some bricks are askew or marked with '#', suggesting issues.
- The background is yellow, but the main content area is white.

Tone and Manner:
- Realistic, empathetic towards the pressures of startup environments.
- It explains a common reason for legacy accumulation – prioritizing immediate survival and goals over perfect code or systems.
- The visual of the stressed character and the caption effectively convey the high-pressure, time-constrained reality of many startups.

Storytelling Method:
- This card begins to answer the "why" behind legacy systems.
- It uses a relatable scenario (startup pressure) and a visual metaphor (stressed developer, crumbling wall) to explain the concept.
- This is presented as the first point in a likely multi-part explanation.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Understanding, provides a practical perspective on why legacy isn't always due to negligence but often a result of pragmatic decisions under pressure.
