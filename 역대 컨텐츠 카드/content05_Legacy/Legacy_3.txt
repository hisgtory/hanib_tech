- Question bubble: "Q. 음,, 아직 잘 모르겠어요!" (Q. Hmm,, I still don't quite get it!)
- Explanation: "레거시는 '기술 부채'라고도 한다고 조금 전 말씀드렸죠? 때로는 과거에 행했던 작업이 부채가 되어 현시점에 청구되는 경우가 있어요." (I mentioned a moment ago that legacy is also called 'technical debt', right? Sometimes, work done in the past becomes debt and is 'billed' in the present.)
- Example 1 (PM): "ex 1. PM이라면" - "과거에 만든 정책들이 새롭게 구현하려는 기능에 제약이 되는 경우, 과거의 정책이 레거시가 되어요." (If policies made in the past restrict newly implemented features, those past policies become legacy.)
- Example 2 (Designer): "ex 2. 디자이너라면" - "디자인 리소스 관리 방식을 변경했을 때, 변경 전 방식의 리소스들이 레거시가 되어요." (When you change the design resource management method, the resources from the pre-change method become legacy.)
