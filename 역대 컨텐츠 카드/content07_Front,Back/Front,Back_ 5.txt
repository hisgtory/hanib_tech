Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Front-End&Back-End"
- Title bubble (black with yellow text): "백엔드 Back-End"
- Explanation: "Front-End의 뒤에서 데이터를 저장, 가공, 제공하는 서버를 Back-End라고 해요." (The server that stores, processes, and provides data behind the Front-End is called Back-End.)
- Dialogue:
  - Character N (cat-like, at laptop): "123번 게시글 데이터 보내주세요!" (Please send the data for post number 123!)
  - Character Hanib (round-headed, holding folders labeled "게시글" (Post), "유저" (User), "댓글" (Comment)): "네! 바로 보내드릴게요" (Okay! I'll send it right away)

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card focuses on defining and illustrating the backend.
- The visual shows character N (representing the frontend/user request) asking for data, and character Hanib (representing the backend) providing it from organized data stores (folders).

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, clear, and uses a simple interaction to explain a concept.
- The character dialogue makes the backend's role (data provision) easy to understand.

Storytelling Method:
- This card elaborates on the "Backend" concept, complementing the previous card on "Frontend."
- It uses a request-response interaction between the characters to demonstrate how the backend serves data to the frontend.
- The folders Hanib holds ("Post," "User," "Comment") visually represent different types of data managed by the backend.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, effectively simplifies the role of the backend in a client-server architecture.
