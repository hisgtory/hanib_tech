Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Front-End&Back-End"
- Main question (from character N, implied): "앱 개발자분들을 클라이언트..? 그렇게도 부르던데 그건 뭔가요?" (App developers are also called client..? What is that?)
- Character Hanib's response (speech bubble): "퇴근 시간이 다 됐는데,, 내일 알려드려도 될까요?" (It's time to go home,, can I tell you tomorrow?)
- Characters N (cat-like, looking curious) and Hanib (round-headed, looking slightly tired/ready to leave) are shown.
- Bottom text on a light gray banner: "다음 편에 계속 :)" (To be continued in the next episode :))

Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The card shows a dialogue between N and Hanib, similar to `Legacy_10.png`. N asks a follow-up question about the term "client," and Hanib defers the answer.

Tone and Manner:
- Engaging, creates anticipation for a new related topic (Client).
- Hanib's excuse ("time to go home") is a relatable way to end a discussion and transition to new content.

Storytelling Method:
- This card acts as a cliffhanger for the current "Frontend/Backend" series and a teaser for an upcoming topic ("Client").
- It uses the established character dynamic to introduce a new question naturally arising from the previous explanations.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Concludes the current topic while smoothly transitioning and building interest for the next one.
