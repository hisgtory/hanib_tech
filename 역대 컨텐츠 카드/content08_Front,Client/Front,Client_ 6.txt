Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Front-End&Client"
- Question bubble (black with yellow text): "Q. 그렇다면 클라이언트 개발자와 프론트엔드 개발자는 어떻게 다른가요?" (Q. Then, how are client developers and frontend developers different?)
- Explanation: "일반적으로 앱 개발자를 클라이언트 개발자, 웹 개발자를 웹 프론트엔드 개발자라고 불러요." (Generally, app developers are called client developers, and web developers are called web frontend developers.)
- Visual: An icon of a desktop monitor and a smartphone in the center.
  - Text to the left of the monitor: "웹 프론트엔드 개발자" (Web frontend developer) with a small monitor icon.
  - Text to the right of the smartphone: "클라이언트 개발자" (Client developer) with a small smartphone icon.

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card distinguishes between "client developer" (often referring to app developers) and "web frontend developer."
- The icons visually associate web frontend with desktop/web and client development more broadly with mobile apps in this context.

Tone and Manner:
- Clarifying, provides a common distinction used in the industry.
- It addresses a specific nuance in job titles and roles.

Storytelling Method:
- This card uses a Q&A format to differentiate between two closely related developer roles.
- It explains that while "frontend" is a general term for the user-facing part, "client developer" is often used specifically for native app (e.g., mobile app) developers, whereas "web frontend developer" is more specific to web technologies.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, aims to clarify industry-specific jargon and role distinctions.
