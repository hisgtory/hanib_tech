- Main title: "서버가 또 다른 서버에 요청을 보낼 때는 서버도 클라이언트가 되어요" (When a server sends a request to another server, that server also becomes a client.)
- Example intro: "예를 들어볼까요!" (Let's take an example!)
- Example explanation: "쇼핑몰 서버가 유저에게 배송 상태를 보여주기 위해서 택배사 API 서버에 요청을 보내 배송 상태를 조회해서 보여줘요. 이때, 택배사 API 서버에게 쇼핑몰 서버는 클라이언트가 되어요." (For a shopping mall server to show the delivery status to a user, it sends a request to the delivery company's API server to inquire and show the delivery status. In this case, the shopping mall server becomes a client to the delivery company's API server.)
- Diagram:
  - Icon of a server stack labeled "Client" (yellow box).
  - Icon of a delivery truck labeled "택배사 API" (Delivery Co. API) (gray box).
  - Arrow from "Client" (shopping mall server) to "택배사 API" labeled "요청" (Request), with example text "배송 상태 알려주세요" (Please tell me the delivery status).
  - Arrow from "택배사 API" to "Client" labeled "응답" (Response), with example text "배송 중입니다 :)" (In transit :)).

Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The card explains how a server can act as a client to another server, using a shopping mall and delivery API as an example. The diagram clearly illustrates this server-to-server (client-server) interaction.

Tone and Manner:
- Illustrative, clear.
- It effectively explains a more complex interaction by breaking it down with a relatable example and a simple diagram.

Storytelling Method:
- This card builds on the previous explanation of "client" as a relative term.
- It provides a concrete example of a server acting as a client, which is a key concept in microservices or distributed architectures.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, aims to deepen the understanding of client-server roles by showing their flexibility and context-dependency.
