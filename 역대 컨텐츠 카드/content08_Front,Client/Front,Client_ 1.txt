Visible Text:
- Top: "Hanib_tech" (yellow text)
- Four yellow ovals with black text: "BE", "Client", "FE", "Server". "Client" and "Server" are slightly larger and more prominent.
- Main question (white text): "프론트엔드와 클라이언트는 다른건가요?" (Are Frontend and Client different?)

Visual Description:
- The background is black.
- The terms "BE" (Backend), "Client", "FE" (Frontend), and "Server" are presented as distinct but related concepts.

Tone and Manner:
- Inquisitive, aims to clarify potentially confusing terminology.
- The visual grouping of terms suggests an exploration of their relationships.

Storytelling Method:
- This is an introductory card for a new topic, likely building on the previous "Frontend/Backend" discussion by introducing "Client" and "Server" more formally.
- It poses a direct question to address a common point of confusion.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, designed to tackle nuanced differences between related technical terms. The dark background with yellow and white text is a common style for this channel.
