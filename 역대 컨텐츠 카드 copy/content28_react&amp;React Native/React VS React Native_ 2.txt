- Explanation:
  - "상호작용이 많은 웹사이트의 UI를 정교하고 효율적으로 개발하고 관리하기 위해 메타에서 만든 JavaScript 라이브러리예요." (It's a JavaScript library made by Meta to develop and manage the UI of highly interactive websites elaborately and efficiently.)
  - "React와 관련 생태계의 등장으로 HTML, CSS로 웹 페이지를 그리는 일을 주로 하는 '웹 퍼블리셔'와 HTML, CSS, JS를 모두 사용하는 '웹 프론트엔드 개발자'의 차이가 명확해졌어요." (With the advent of React and its related ecosystem, the difference between 'web publishers' who mainly draw web pages with HTML, CSS, and 'web frontend developers' who use HTML, CSS, and JS all together became clear.)
- Character Hanib (at laptop, giving a thumbs up) is shown at the bottom.
