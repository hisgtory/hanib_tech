Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech"
- Large black text: "이게 그렇게나 핫하다구요?" (Is this really that hot/trendy?)

Visual Description:
- The background is white.
- A large black stylized "@" symbol, resembling the logo of Meta's "Threads" app, is prominently displayed above the text.

Tone and Manner:
- Inquisitive, timely, and slightly skeptical or curious.
- It taps into the buzz around a new social media platform (Threads, at the time of its launch).

Storytelling Method:
- This is an introductory card for a new topic: the Threads app.
- It uses the app's logo and a question reflecting public curiosity or hype to immediately engage the audience.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Current events-focused, aims to provide information or a perspective on a trending topic in the tech/social media space. The minimalist design (white background, black logo and text) is a departure from the usual yellow/dark gray, perhaps to match the branding of Threads or to signify a different type of content (e.g., news/commentary).
