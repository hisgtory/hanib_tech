Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "HTTP status code"
- Title bubble (black with white text): "403 Forbidden 🚫" (No entry sign emoji added)
- Main explanation:
  - "권한 없음을 뜻해요." (It means no permission.)
  - "URL은 공유 받았는데, 클릭을 해보니 권한이 없으니 요청하라는 화면을 보신 적 있으신가요?" (Have you ever received a shared URL, but when you clicked it, you saw a screen asking you to request permission because you don't have it?)
  - "조회할 권한이 없거나, 삭제할 권한이 없는 경우에 서버는 403을 줄 수 있어요." (If you don't have permission to view or delete, the server can return a 403.)
- Example UI element: A screenshot of a Google Drive/Docs "Access denied" type of page. It shows "Google 프레젠테이션" (Google Slides), "액세스 권한 필요" (Access permission needed), an image of a keyhole, and an input field for "메일(선택사항)" (Email (optional)) with a button "액세스 요청" (Request access).

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card explains the "403 Forbidden" HTTP status code.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, relatable.
- It explains that this code means the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.

Storytelling Method:
- This card focuses on a specific error-related HTTP status code (403 Forbidden).
- It uses a very common scenario (trying to access a shared document without permission) to illustrate the meaning of 403.
- The screenshot of the Google Drive/Docs access request page is a highly recognizable example.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, clearly explains a common error code related to permissions, using a familiar user experience to make it understandable.
