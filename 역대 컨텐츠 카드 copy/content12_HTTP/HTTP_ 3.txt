Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "HTTP status code"
- Title bubble (black with white text): "200 OK 👍"
- Main explanation:
  - "요청에 대해 성공적으로 응답하였다는 뜻이에요." (It means the request was successfully responded to.)
  - "응답 코드가 200이면 클라이언트는 “잘 처리됐구나😋” 하고 UI를 렌더링 하거나 안내 문구를 노출하고 다음 단계로 넘어가요." (If the response code is 200, the client thinks "It was processed well 😋", renders the UI or displays a guide message, and moves to the next step.)
- Example UI element (gray button at bottom): "게시물을 성공적으로 수정했어요" (The post was successfully modified.)

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card explains the meaning and implication of the "200 OK" HTTP status code.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, positive (reflecting the "OK" status).
- The emoji 😋 adds a touch of friendliness.

Storytelling Method:
- This card focuses on a specific HTTP status code (200 OK).
- It explains what the code signifies (successful request) and how a client might react to it (render UI, show success message).
- The example button text ("The post was successfully modified.") provides a concrete example of a success message a user might see after a 200 OK response.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, clearly explains one of the most common and important HTTP status codes.
