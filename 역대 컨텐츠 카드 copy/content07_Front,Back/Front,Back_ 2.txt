Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The card clearly defines frontend and backend, using two distinct boxes with icons, associated technologies, and simple descriptions.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, clear, and structured.
- Uses simple language and visual aids (icons, technology tags) to differentiate between frontend and backend.

Storytelling Method:
- This card provides a foundational explanation of frontend and backend.
- It uses a comparative layout to highlight the differences.
- The core distinction ("visible to user" vs. "not visible to user") is made very clear.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, aims to provide a basic understanding of the two main components of web/app development. The visual separation and key terms make it easy to digest.
