Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Front-End&Client"
- Speech bubble 1 (Hanib, implied): "클라이언트 개발자는 서버에 요청을 보내 받아온 정보를 UI로 표현해줘요." (Client developers send requests to the server and express the received information as UI.)
- Character N (cat-like, hand to chin) with a dark speech bubble: "그럼 클라이언트랑 프론트엔드는 완전 같은 뜻인가요?" (Then, are client and frontend completely the same meaning?)
- Speech bubble 2 (Hanib, character at laptop): "그건 아니에요. '클라이언트'는 상대적인 용어이기 때문이에요. 그래서 가끔은 서버도 클라이언트가 될 수 있어요!" (That's not it. It's because 'client' is a relative term. So sometimes, even a server can be a client!)

Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The card shows a dialogue between character N and character Hanib, clarifying the relationship between "client" and "frontend."

Tone and Manner:
- Clarifying, nuanced.
- It addresses a common point of confusion by explaining that "client" is a relative term, not always synonymous with "frontend."
- The idea that a server can also be a client is an important distinction.

Storytelling Method:
- This card uses a Q&A dialogue format to explore the subtleties of technical terminology.
- It builds on the previous definitions by tackling a more advanced or nuanced aspect of client-server architecture.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, aims to provide a deeper and more accurate understanding of the term "client" by highlighting its relational nature.
