- Explanation: "웹 브라우저가 존재하기 전까지 클라이언트는 모두 컴퓨터 프로그램이었어요. 기기에 설치해서 사용하는 앱도 프로그램이기에 '클라이언트'라고 불리게 되었어요." (Before web browsers existed, all clients were computer programs. Since apps installed on devices are also programs, they came to be called 'clients'.)
- Check Point box (yellow header with checkmark): "✓CHECK POINT"
  - "앱 = 프로그램" (App = Program)
  - "앱 개발자 ⇒ 클라이언트 개발자" (App Developer ⇒ Client Developer)
