- Explanation: "반면에 웹사이트는 크롬과 같은 웹 브라우저에서 실행되는 HTML, CSS, JS로 이루어진 코드 묶음으로, 설치해서 사용하는 프로그램은 아니다 보니 '웹 프론트엔드'라는 이름이 새로 생기게 되었어요." (On the other hand, websites are bundles of code made of HTML, CSS, JS that run in web browsers like Chrome. Since they are not programs installed and used, the new name 'web frontend' emerged.)
- Check Point box (yellow header with checkmark): "✓CHECK POINT"
  - "웹 사이트 ≠ 프로그램" (Website ≠ Program)
  - "웹 사이트 개발자 ⇒ 웹 프론트엔드 개발자" (Website Developer ⇒ Web Frontend Developer)
