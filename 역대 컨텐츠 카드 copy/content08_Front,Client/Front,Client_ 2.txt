Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The card clearly defines "Client" using text and a simple request-response diagram between a client (desktop/mobile) and a server.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, clear, and foundational.
- The diagram effectively visualizes the client-server interaction model.

Storytelling Method:
- This card starts by defining "Client."
- It uses a visual diagram to illustrate the core function of a client: making requests to a server and receiving responses.
- The example request ("send post info") and response ("post data, image, comments") are concrete and easy to understand.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, aims to provide a clear definition and visual representation of what a client is in a client-server architecture.
