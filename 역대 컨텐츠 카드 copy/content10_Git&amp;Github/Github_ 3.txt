- Explanation: "Git은 프로젝트를 구성하는 수많은 파일들을 평면적인 파일과 폴더의 집합이 아닌 변경사항의 연속으로 관리할 수 있게 해줘요. 이미지 한 줄 한 줄의 변경사항을 commit이라고 불러요." (Git allows you to manage the numerous files that make up a project not as a flat collection of files and folders, but as a sequence of changes. Each line of change in the image is called a commit.)
