Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Git&Github"
- Explanation: "pull을 통해서 변경 사항을 다운로드할 수 있어요. 디자이너와 PM이 피그마와 노션 등을 통해 협업하듯이 개발자들은 깃헙을 통해 협업하지요." (You can download changes through pull. Just as designers and PMs collaborate through Figma and Notion, developers collaborate through GitHub.) The word "pull" is highlighted in yellow.
- Diagram:
  - Top row: GitHub logo (Octocat) followed by a timeline of commits: "첫 커밋 hi.txt" -> "오타 수정 hi.txt" -> "기획안 업데이트 2023/plan" (highlighted with sparkles).
  - Bottom row: Character N (cat-like, peeking from behind a wall), followed by a similar timeline of local commits, but the last commit is initially different or older.
  - A yellow "PULL" box with a downward arrow connects the "기획안 업데이트 2023/plan" from the GitHub timeline to N's local timeline, updating it.

Visual Description:
- The background is yellow, with the main content on a white rounded rectangle.
- The card explains the "pull" operation in Git/GitHub, showing how a local repository (represented by character N) gets updated with changes from the remote GitHub repository.

Tone and Manner:
- Informative, collaborative.
- It draws an analogy to tools used by other team members (Figma, Notion) to make the concept of GitHub as a collaboration tool more understandable.

Storytelling Method:
- This card explains another core Git/GitHub operation: "pull."
- It complements the previous card about "push" by showing the other direction of synchronization.
- The visual clearly depicts changes from the remote repository being brought down to a local one.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, emphasizes GitHub's role in team collaboration by enabling developers to share and synchronize their work.
