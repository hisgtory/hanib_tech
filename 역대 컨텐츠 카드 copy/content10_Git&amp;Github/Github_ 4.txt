  - "해시" (Hash) pointing to the commit hash.
- Explanation: "Commit은 해시(커밋마다 가지는 고유한 ID), 메세지, 파일들의 변경 내역, 이전 커밋의 해시 등의 값으로 구성되어 있어요." (A Commit is composed of values such as a hash (unique ID for each commit), message, file change history, hash of the previous commit, etc.) The terms "해시", "메세지", "파일들의 변경 내역", "이전 커밋의 해시" are highlighted in yellow boxes.
