- Question bubble: "Q. 리팩터링은 언제 해야하고 얼마나 걸리나요?" (Q. When should refactoring be done and how long does it take?)
- Numbered points (indicators for when refactoring might be needed):
  1.  "버그가 많거나 개발 속도가 느려진 것 같다면" (If there are many bugs or development speed seems to have slowed down)
  2.  "최근에 신규 기능을 급하게 출시했다면" (If you recently rushed to release a new feature)
- Statement: "리팩터링이 필요한 시점일지도 몰라요!" (It might be time for refactoring!)
- Explanation of duration: "리팩터링은 여러 요인에 따라 기간이 달라져요. 작은 프로젝트의 경우 한 주에서 n주 단위로 수행되고, 대규모 프로젝트의 경우 분기 단위로 진행되기도 해요." (The duration of refactoring varies depending on several factors. For small projects, it's performed in units of one to n weeks, and for large-scale projects, it can proceed in quarterly units.)
