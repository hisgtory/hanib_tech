Visible Text:
- Top left: "Hanib_tech", Top right: "Refactoring"
- Speech bubble 1 (from Hanib, implied): "아 참, 대규모 공사이다보니 리팩터링 후 처음보는 버그들이 발견될 수 있어요." (Oh, and since it's a large-scale operation, new bugs might be discovered after refactoring.)
- Character N (cat-like, looking shocked/confused) with a dark speech bubble: "버그가 수정되는게 아니라 더 생길 수도 있다고요?" (You mean bugs might increase instead of being fixed?)
- Speech bubble 2 (from Hanib, character shown with a slightly concerned/serious expression): "네, 그렇기 때문에 QA를 꼭 진행해야 하고, 여유가 있는 팀일 경우 테스트 코드를 작성해 본 다면 리팩터링 전후의 안정성 문제를 해결할 수 있어요." (Yes, that's why QA must be done, and if the team has capacity, writing test code can help resolve stability issues before and after refactoring.)

Visual Description:
- The background is light gray.
- The card depicts a conversation between character N (shocked) and character Hanib (explaining calmly but seriously).

Tone and Manner:
- Realistic, cautionary, and informative.
- It addresses a potential downside or risk of refactoring (introducing new bugs) and emphasizes the importance of mitigation strategies like QA and test code.
- N's shocked reaction is relatable, as one might expect refactoring to only fix problems.

Storytelling Method:
- This card uses a dialogue format to discuss a critical aspect of refactoring: the risk of new issues and the necessity of thorough testing.
- It presents a potential problem and then offers solutions (QA, test code), providing practical advice.

Overall Atmosphere:
- Educational, provides a balanced view of refactoring by acknowledging its risks alongside its benefits, and stresses the importance of good development practices.
